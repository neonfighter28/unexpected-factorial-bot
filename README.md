# unexpected-factorial-bot

to setup you will need a discord bot token which you can get [here](https://discord.com/developers)

just paste that token into the variable on the fifth line and invite the bot to your server

oh and youll also need [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which you can install with ```python -m pip install discord```
